# minecraft-c-sharp

This is an old project, an attempt at recreating minecraft in c# in unity (ikr, such a novel idea)

This project was written in mid 2019, thus it was using whatever latest version of free unity was available, the likely hood of this project simply not working anymore is very high given lots's of changes in unity since then and my lack of technical knowledge at the time

## Basic idea of the project

- blocks would be a mesh class made of face meshes
- the world generation simply consist of placing block on the z-x axes with no concern for verticality (y axis), like I stated before lack of, rather severe lack of technical knowledge, skills and time to make up for that, probably even motivation


## Issues

- Low FPS
  - as far as I remember the lag was severe, even with tiny world generation and size
- poor implementation of meshs that make up the faces of each block
- poor implementation of terain generation, if it can even be called that
